# Visual Artist, Web Programmer
  My technical digital skills are mainly within the Adobe Suite, but I am thrilled to be learning how to program. I started FreeCodeCamp in October of 2023.
  
  Programming and electronic diagrams have always seemed Greek to me, and I love a challenge. 
  
  I'm taking engineering classes right now in the Los Angeles City College District


## It's my seventh year in LA and I'm very excited about some projects!
  ### UrFriends

  UrFriends is a central place to develop and promote human connections in your life. Apple and Google interaction permit users to keep track of relationships and conversations. 
  
  ### Widow
  High visibility clothing and apparel for urban commuters. Sample production incoming.
  
  ### My Personal Website
  My github pages is a nice place to slipshoddenly show various creations. I am working on a React.js build that will be a showcase of more skills.

  ### Content On My Website!!!
  I have several projects that I am excited to be converting into decks that describe their status.
